# Scanduim
Java RTS, largely based on the ideas of [1500 archers](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131503/1500_archers_on_a_288_network_.php) and [Lost Colony](https://github.com/adityaravishankar/last-colony) and using [Slick2d](http://slick.ninjacave.com/). Art currently in the repo is by Daniel Cook [lostgarden.com](http://lostgarden.com), and includes pieces from the [Hard Vaccum](http://lunar.lostgarden.com/game_HardVacuum.htm) and [Tyrian](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/04/free-game-graphics-tyrian-ships-and.html) collections. For all of the cool features, see [the manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y-qbPgrG3gHgKPfizcKuQPnmFZgPZwrBPDW7QLmqBqg/edit?usp=sharing).

# Possible Improvements
It needs a proper menu/lobby system. Should not be too hard to make with the existing GUI classes, but the net code for it simply isn't there yet. The server needs an extra default port where it can then transfer users to an open port. Currently the project will load graphics and tilemaps, but all of the unit and button set data is inside Java literals (src/data/DummyDataLoaderWithLiterals.java). It would be much cooler if that was not the case-it should read the data from a JSON file. Another issue is the lack of sound. Finally, I started working on a building construction system, but it was never completed.
